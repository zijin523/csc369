Q4: [7 marks] Shell

[2 marks]
a) Write a small shell program such that the line below will print the number of files or directories in the current working directory.  You do not need to count hidden files or directories. Only one number should be printed.
ANSWER:
#!/bin/bash

num_files=0
files=*
for i in $files
do
    num_files=`expr $num_files + 1`
done
echo $num_files

b) Write a Bourne shell program that takes one command line argument.  The
command line argument is the name of an executable program that your program
executes once for each file in the current working directory that begins
with "test".  It runs the program on each file in sequence so that one
completes before the next one starts. If the program returns 0 then it
prints a message indicating that the program completed successfully,
otherwise it prints a message indicating that the program failed. Your program
does not need to check for errors with the command line argument.

For example, if the program is run as "sh_runit sim", and the current
working directory contains

test1 test2 test3 notes.txt

then the result is that "sim" is run on each of the files:

sim test1
sim test2
sim test3

If sim returned 0 for the last two instances of sim, but not
the first, it prints:

sim test1 failed
sim test2 terminated successfully
sim test3 terminated successfully

ANSWER:

#!/bin/bash
files=*
for i in $files
do
$* $i
if [ $? -eq 0 ]
then
    echo "$* $i" terminated successfully
else
    echo "$* $i" failed
fi
done
