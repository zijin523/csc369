b) It is important to close all open descriptors on a pipe that the parent 
   will not be using to communicate with a child process before fork is called.
ANSWER_b:FALSE


c) The current working directory contains files named "apple" and "banana". 
   When the following shell program is run with command line arguments "cat" 
   and "dog", the output will be "apple" and "banana" on separate lines.

        for i in $*
        do
            echo $i
        done

ANSWER_c:FALSE

   available for other processes to use.
ANSWER_g: FALSE


h) The statements below give y the value of the upper 16 bits of x.

        unsigned int x = VALUE;  // assume VALUE is a valid number
        unsigned int y = x >> 16;
ANSWER_h: TRUE

 
i) Assume the following program runs without errors. Select the option
   that best describes the output, and write that letter beside ANSWER.

int main() {
    int foo = 4;
    int bar = 5;
    int *ptr = &bar;
    
    pid_t process = fork();
    if(process == 0) {
        *ptr += foo;
        exit(0);
    } else {
        printf("%d\n", *ptr);
    }
    return 0;
}

A. The program will always print 9.
B. The program will always print 5.
