The starvation will not happen when using this moniter.  
Starvation happens when mutiple jobs aquire for the same resource and the order of gaining 
the resource can be determined by the unfair strategy such as the priority of the jobs.  
However, in our code, the jobs are added into queues which obtain FIFO. 
Therefore, for jobs in the same queue, only the earlies job can 
acquire for the resource and later job has to wait it to finish.  Since by this strategy, 
the waiting time of each job is guaranted and every job has a fairly way to acquire for the 
resource, Starvation will not happen. 
Since in a single queue, only the earlies job can acquire for the resource.  Then we should
consider for the job in different queues. Becuase the thread are excuting randomly and every 
thread have an equal chance to be excuted, the earlies jobs in the queues have an equal chance 
to gain the resources. By the definition of starvation, it occurs when an unfair strategy is 
used to disturbate resouces for the jobs.  Since in our code, the order of jobs acquiring for 
the resources is randomly and have an equal chance, therefore, it against the definition and 
starvation will not occur.
